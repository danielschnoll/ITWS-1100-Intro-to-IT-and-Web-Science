        My programming story beings in my Senior year of high school. I took AP Computer Science and learned Java. I loved the multifaceted problem solving approach that programming offered, and before I knew it, I was hooked. I applied to college as a Computer Science major, and was admitted to <a href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. That following summer, I secured a Full Stack Developer internship at Hickory Training in NYC where I worked with Django Python and React.JS. In my Sophomore year, I declared a dual major in ITWS (IT and Web Science). If you so desire, you can follow my growth and progress as a budding developer via my <a href = "http://github.com/danielschnoll">Github</a>.

        On campus, I am the President of the Troy Consulting Club. Our primary focus is volunteer freelance work in the Troy community, focusing mainly on small businesses. Every business needs a solid web presence - without a good website, a company is missing out on tons of coverage and outreach. To boost the Troy economy and make it a more community friendly environment, we find companies that have little to no web presence and volunteer to make a website for them.

        I am also a member of the RPI Rubik's Cubing Club, and consider myself an avid speed-cuber. Fun fact: I am an avid speed-cuber, and thoroughly enjoy collecting and solving a variety of puzzles. I also participate in the Computer Science Club, and have participated in our hackathon, HackRPI. Additionally, I am a Brother at the <a href ="http://pskrpi.com">Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity (Gamma Tetarton)</a> chapter on campus. When I am not doing school work or hanging out with my friends, I can usually be found taking Tae Kwon Do classes, playing golf, or reading. I am actually a 3rd Dan black belt, and have been involved with Tae Kwon Do for 14 years.
